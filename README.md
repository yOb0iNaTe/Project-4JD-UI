# VDX: Project 4JD UI

### An legacy console UI design for MC Win10 Bedrock.

### NOTE: From now on I will try to update the project every Wednesday adding features and bug fixes.

#### Description ####

Is an testing/experimental resource pack that would change some UI designs, and the goal of this project is convert from default UI to high accuracy 4JD (Legacy Console) UI TP for Bedrock Edition users, replacing some designs to look more similar!

The UI design was originally made by Julie "Danger" Kennedy from 4J Studios! I simply recreate the UI port for Bedrock Edition ;D.

For now it will be designated only for PC Windows 10 or Consoles.

For mobile (Mini version) it will be available for late 2021.

#### Current Features ####

- Anvil screen.
- Beacon screen.
- Trade v2 screen.
- Classic Inventory and Crafting screen (Just like JE UI).
- Creative Screen.

#### To do list ####

- CE 3x3 and 2x2 Crafting screen (10%, still in progress).
- Start screen.
- Pause screen.
- Progress screen.
- HUD screen.

#### License ####

This project will be open source and under the GNU GPL v3.0.

If you have more questions about this, let me know by MD on my twitter @CrisXolt.

#### Rules to test ####

Note: The only prerequisite before testing is that you make sure you have mid-range or high-end PC with Windows 10 installed, or you have Xbox One/Series console. Otherwise, the bug report will likely be ignored (So, don't do it if you have mobile device).

It is highly recommended to use only with the Xinput control, the use with keyboard and mouse will work partially.

At the moment, you can:
- Test and report bugs.
- Make reviews about project 4JD if you want. (At your own risk)

You can't:
- Redistribute the master (current) version to other pages.

#### Known Issues ####

- It takes about 14 seconds to open the inventory screen. But it only happens once and it will take less than 2 seconds more than the second time.
- At the moment, it is not recommended for use with another resource pack, much less when applied to a single world.
